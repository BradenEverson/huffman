Huffman Encoding from Scratch

A simple Min-Heap, Huffman Tree and Bit Writer implementation that allows for proper encoding and decoding of binary data :)

This repo provides:

- A min heap implementation from scratch (following https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/min-heap-binary-tree)
- A Huffman tree encoding method that supports:
    - Building a huffman tree from a message
    - Encoding data according to that tree
    - Decoding data according to that tree
- A BitWriter used when encoding instructions

Todos:

- [ ] The current implementation uses an ArrayList(u1) for simplicity when getting instructions, this can obviously be optimized
- [ ] A form of serialization for the tree itself to send to the receiver alongside the data, as you need the tree to do the decoding.
